    <p>Spectre is a cross-platform spectral raytracing renderer written in C++, meant to be used as a standalone program or alongside 3D packages such as Blender as a renderer plugin.</p>
    <p>Inspired by previous works such as PBRT and SORT, and written as a successor to <a href="https://github.com/Eclmist/Elixir" target="_blank">Elixir</a>, Spectre is physically based and implements similar features such as different integrators (witted, path tracing), special acceleration structures, and various BXDFs. The project is still very early in its development stages.</p>
