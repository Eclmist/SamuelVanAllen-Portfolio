    <p>Elixir is a cross-platform raytracing renderer written in C++, meant to be used as a standalone program or alongside 3D packages such as Blender and Cauldron as a renderer plugin.</p>
    <p>Inspired by previous works such as PBRT and SORT, Elixir is physically based and implements similar features such as different integrators (witted, path tracing), special acceleration structures, and various BXDFs. The project is still very early in its development stages.</p>
