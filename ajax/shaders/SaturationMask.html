    <p><b>Made as part of the game Wither.</b></p>
    <p>Stencil Saturation Mask is a screen space image effect that selectively desaturates parts of the rendered frame. In the game Wither, this effect is used to allow the player to spread colors from his feet. </p>
    <p>This effect is achieved with 2 main steps: </p>
    <ul class="steps">
        <li>Draw invisible stencil masks to the screen. (Particle Systems were used in the case of Wither, to allow for instancing) </li>
        <li>Desaturate the rendered frame while sampling the stencil buffer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some workarounds had to be used in <i>Unity</i> specifically, as the stencil buffer is cleared after the lighting pass. We can, in this case, render the mask to a seperate buffer. I described this issue (and a solution) <a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/132045/selective-image-effects-with-stencils" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
