    <h2>Sword Intersection</h2>

    <p>This original effect allows for accurate sword intersections to be rendered on all meshes.</p>
    <p>A sword trail is masked with the stencil buffer, and fragments are further discarded after comparism with depth texture. The unoccluded fragments can then be rendered however you want the intersection area to look.</p>
