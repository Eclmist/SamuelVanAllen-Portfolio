    <p>Dissolve is a frament shader that masks the mesh based on perlin noise, and applies a color ramp to edges.</p>
    <p>This effect is achieved with main 2 steps: </p>
    <ul class="steps">
        <li>Fragments are discarded based on perlin noise</li>
        <li>An edge ramp is sampled using the fragment's current value on the noise texture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Unity's surface shader wrapper is used to enable forward shadows that account for discarded pixels.
