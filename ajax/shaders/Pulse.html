    <p>Pulse also writes to the saturation mask described above using fragment to world space arithmetics.</p>
    <p>This effect is achieved with 3 steps: </p>
    <ul class="steps">
        <li>Calculate viewport position of starting point of pulse</li>
        <li>Sample depth texture and calculate world position of each fragment using camera's position</li>
        <li>Compare distance and write value to saturation mask accordingly. UV positions per fragment is also offset to produce a distortion effect along the edges of the pulse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A sphere collider also expands at the same rate and triggers code to make invisible objects glow.
