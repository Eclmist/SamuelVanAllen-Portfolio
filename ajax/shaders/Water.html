    <p><b>Made with Unreal Engine's material editor</b></p>
    <p>This custom water material is created using a combination of the following:</p>
    <ul class="steps">
        <li>A scrolling normal map for waves</li>
        <li>Fresnel for both water color and reflection</li>
        <li>Vertex offset with using world space position and sine function</li>
        <li>Depth fade for both color and reflections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This was considerably one of the easier materials to create, considering unreal's material nodes handled most of the logic (built in fresnel and depth calculations, etc).</p>
