    <p><b>Made as part of the game Aether.</b></p>
    <p>Inspired by the similar visual effect in Beyond Eyes, this effect reveals the environment wherever deemed appropriate by design. This method is slightly different in that we make use of a 3D texture as a visibility mask and a compute shader to update the mask texels, rather than through the more inefficient approach of updating vertex colors directly.</p>
    <p>There are two main components to this effect.</p>
    <ul class="steps">
        <li>A 3D texture that is dynamically updated by a compute shader</li>
        <li>Materials that sample the 3D texture as a mask for visibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rest is a little bit of tech art (glowing, flowing edges with noise and color ramp, etc.)</p>
