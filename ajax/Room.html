        <p>Unity can look amazing.</p>
        <p>This fully VR ready room was created with photorealism in mind. Most artifacts associated with the "Unity" look has been eliminated. 

        </p><p>This was done by accurately and carefully tweeking PBR materials, utilizing Enlighten for realtime psuedo ray traced lights with baked emmisive maps with light/reflection probles for non-static objects, and Playdead's temporal AA to eliminate Unity's harsh edge look. Dithering was also used to eliminate colorbanding caused by Unity's post process stack which uses LDR buffers.</p>
