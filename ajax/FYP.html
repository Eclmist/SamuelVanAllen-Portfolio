        <p>Snowfield is a final year VR project that developed during my time in Singapore polytecnic.</p>
        <p>The player will be able to craft weapons and potions, sell and buy items from adventurers, and participate in combat with hostile creatures.</p>
        <p>Some notable features implemented includes a multithreaded mesh comparer that compares procedural meshes for similarities as well as a <i>cut / tear</i> shader that renders sword slashes directly on objects, even skinned meshes. All of the visual effects implemented in this project is VR ready, and many of which are documented on the <i>Rendering</i> subsection of this project page. Slides showcasing many of the features in Snowfield can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H7wkwN-7Xc-Jsy4ArUziyipj_JzpkTXxKqoRKPyc4ZU/edit#slide=id.g1e276c89f8_0_244">here</a>.</p>
