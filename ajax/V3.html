                <p>Vectortree is a 2 player co-op rouguelike bullet-hell game.</p>
                <p>Made during a 30 hour game jam at James Cook University, it was highly inspired by the game "Geometry Wars", V3 was our attempt to create a game that looked visually stunning, yet fit the retro theme of the game jam.</p>
                <p>Some notable effects implemented in V3 includes a bullet wavefront effect - essentially a multithreaded cloth simulation, as well as a couple of image effects.</p>
