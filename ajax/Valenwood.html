                <p>Valenwood was one of my first full projects with Unity. Many elements such as the HUD and sound were <i>borrowed</i> from Skyrim.</p>
                <p>As much as Valenwood was a assignment, it was also a personal challenge to see to what extend can one replicate the graphical fidelity of a AAA title with little time and resource. </p>
