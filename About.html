                <div id="about-desc">
                <p>I studied computer science at the National University of Singapore, graduated Singapore Polytechnic with a diploma in information technology as the course medalist, and have been making games since 2012. I am currently a rendering programmer intern at Ubisoft Singapore (Skull & Bones).</p>
                <br>
                <p>I strongly believe that good graphics can make the worst games good and as such, graphics has always been my top priority during development. Having worked mostly with Unity in the past, I soon realised that its basic functionalities was insufficient, and could not produce many of the visual effects that I was looking for. My search for real-time rendering techniques and special effects led me into the world of graphics programming.</p>
