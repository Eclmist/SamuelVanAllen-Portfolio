                <div id="about-desc">
                <p>I am a second year student (2016) in Singapore Polytechnic, studying Games development as part of my diploma course. I have been making games for close to 6 years now, with experiences in Unity 5, Unreal, OpenGL, XNA and DirectX.</p>
    
                <p>I strongly believe that good visuals are one of the most crucial elements of video games. Making my games look good was always my top priority during development. Having worked mostly with Unity in the past, I soon realised that its basic functionalities was insufficient, and could not provide many of the visual effects that I was looking for. My search for high fidelity rendering and special effects led me into the world of graphics programming.</p>

                <p>Anyone can write whatever they want on their portfolio. I'd much rather show you some of the projects that I'm involved in instead. Head on over to my projects page and take a look at some of my new (and old) projects!</p>

            	<h3>When I'm not making games</h3>
                <p>I have a bit of hobby in everything. I do magic tricks, plays the guitar, piano, and drums, loves to play pool, a little addicted to CS:GO and brawlhalla (<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/eclmist">Steam</a>), watches a bit too much anime and subsequently loves to draw digital illustration of moe anime girls (<a href="http://eclmist.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a>), you get the idea.</p>
    
				<p>I also am weirdly obsessed with Rem, at least enough to spend the time to make <a href="http://www.downloadmorerem.com">DownloadMoreRemâ„¢</a></p>
