                <div id="about-desc">
                <p>I'm a Graphics Engineer at Sony Interactive Entertainment working on next-gen graphics features for the PlayStation. Previously, I was a rendering programmer at Ubisoft Singapore.</p>

                <p>I'm super passionate about computer graphics how far the industry has come for us to be able to synthesize photorealistic images, even in real-time. Shaders, graphics APIs, rendering techniques and raytracing are some of the topics that I enjoy researching and working with. Outside of computer graphics, I also have a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering.</p>
