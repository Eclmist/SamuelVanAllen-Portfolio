                <h2>About</h2>
                <div id="about-desc">
                <p>I studied computer science at the National University of Singapore, graduated as the top student at Singapore Polytechnic, and have been making games since 2012. I'm a <a href="https://studentpartners.microsoft.com">Microsoft Student Partner</a> and was previously an Assistant Rendering Programer at Ubisoft Singapore.</p>
		<p>I'm super passionate about computer graphics how far the industry has come for us to be able to synthesize photorealistic images, sometimes even in real-time. Shaders, graphics APIs, real-time rendering techniques and raytracing are some of the topics that I enjoy researching and working with. Outside of computer graphics, I also have a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering.</p>
