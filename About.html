			<p>I am a first year student (2015) in Singapore Polytechnic taking Diploma in Information Technology. I have been making games for close to 4 years now, with experiences with DirectX, XNA, Unreal and Unity3D.</p>

			<p>I have made many games in the past, on both the Windows platform, as well as for Android. Some of these games are showcased in my portfolio page.</p>

			<p>I am someone who loves to experiment with the tools that are avaliable to me, and I'm not afraid to try new things espicially when it comes to new game mechanics, design, as well as programming in general.</p>
