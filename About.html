                <h2>Hi! I'm Samuel</h2>
                <div id="about-desc">
                <p>I'm a final year student in Singapore Polytechnic studying Games development as part of my diploma course. I have been making games since 2013.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>I'm a aspiring graphics programmer</h2>
                <p>I strongly believe that good visuals are one of the most crucial elements of video games; It has always been my top priority during development. Having worked mostly with Unity in the past, I soon realised that its basic functionalities was insufficient, and could not produce many of the visual effects that I was looking for. My search for real-time rendering techniques and special effects led me into the world of graphics programming.</p>

                <p>I'm someone who works well with concepts, regardless of the tool. This website, for instance, was written when I had little javascript or CSS background, but was possible because concepts from games development easily carried over.</p>

                <p>Anyone can write whatever they want on their portfolio. I'd much rather show you some of the projects that I'm involved in instead. Head on over to my <a href="#projects">projects page</a> and take a look at some of my new (and old) projects!</p>

            	<h3>When I'm not making games</h3>
                <p>I have a bit of hobby in everything. I do magic tricks, play the guitar, piano, drums, chess, board games, pool, Osu, CS:GO, Brawlhalla (<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/eclmist" target="_blank">Steam</a>), anime, you get the idea.</p>
    
				<p>I am also the developer of <a href="http://www.downloadmorerem.com" target="_blank">DownloadMoreRem</a> and <a href="http://rubberduckdebugger.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank">Rubber Duck Debugger</a>.</p>
