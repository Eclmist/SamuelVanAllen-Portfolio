                <h2>Hi! I'm Samuel</h2>
                <div id="about-desc">
                <p>I'm a student studying computer science at the National University of Singapore. I graduated Singapore Polytechnic with a diploma in information technology and was the gold medalist of my cohort. I have been making games since 2012.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Aydlesoft</h2>
                <p>I'm one of the 4 co-founders of Aydlesoft Pte. Ltd. More information about our company can be found on our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/aydlesoft">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 style="text-align: left">I'm a aspiring graphics programmer and technical artist</h2>
                <p>I strongly believe that good visuals are one of the most crucial elements of video games; It has always been my top priority during development. Having worked mostly with Unity in the past, I soon realised that its basic functionalities was insufficient, and could not produce many of the visual effects that I was looking for. My search for real-time rendering techniques and special effects led me into the world of graphics programming.</p>

                <p>I'm someone who works well with concepts, regardless of the tool. This website, for instance, was written when I had little javascript or CSS background, but was possible because concepts from games development easily carried over.</p>
